Kubernetes: “a container orchestration technology (Microsoft) used to orchestrate and manage the deployment of containers in a clustered environment” (kodekloud: kubernetes for the absolute beginners).

–architecture:
*node(minion): machine whether physical or virtual
*cluster: a set of nodes
*master: a node within kubernetes responsible of the orchistration 
*components:
     -API server (frontend)
     -scheduler (distributes work)
     -controller(in case a node goes down, notices and responds =>decision to bring up new containers)
     -container runtime (software to run containers)
     -kubelet (agent running on each node in the cluster)
     -etcd(key-value store =>implementing logs within the cluster)

**kubeclt: used to deploy and manage apps on a cluster
kubectl run :deploy an app on the cluster
kubectl cluster -info: view info about the cluster
kubectl get nodes: list of all the nodes part of the cluster

*minikube: a whole bundle image packaged to be executed
* Pod: a kubernetes object =>a single instance of an app (the smallest object in kubernetes)
